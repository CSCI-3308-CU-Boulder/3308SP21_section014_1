## Application Description

Our app is called Space Defender. Space Defender is a flappy bird style game capturing all the excitement of futuristic space exploration! The game will be hosted on its very own website with several features. At the outset, new users will be prompted to create their ver own profile with a custom username and password. Upon registration, users will then be treated to the most cutting edge graphical interface possible! (within 16 weeks of amateur production by students) Gazing at the amazing functionality of our menu, users can start a new game, view and most recent high scores.  It may even be possible to send messages to other players (time permitting). From here, users will not be able to contain their excitement and will rush to start a new game. Upon accessing the game, the user will notice that the astronaut ummediately plummets to the first of many deaths. Then, upon accepting the replay and clicking literally anywhere other than the play button, the countdown to adventure begins! Set in an exciting, vibrant and totally immersive futuristic struggle for the destiny of the universe, you are known simply as "The Astronaut". Your superpower? To somehow be affected by gravity in an extremely predictable way even in deep space! Shot down behind enemy lines, you must escape back to the resistance base. Marvel at wave after wave of electrified barrier that you must squeeze through or perish in the attempt. Experience a Kafka-esque never-ending Groundhog day like experience as you die over and over in a futile effort to return to friendly space. Just like real life!
	Our users will be casual phone gamers and people who have fifteen minutes to kill. Maybe people waiting in line at the post office.

## Application Architecture

On the front end for our game, we will be using Unity. Our language for the backend will be python on aws. Unity Should be able to allow our front and back end to communicate. Honestly, none of us really understand what any of this is yet and our googling has yielded minimal results so we’re actually hoping we go over some of this stuff in class or are given some resources to understand what these are.
