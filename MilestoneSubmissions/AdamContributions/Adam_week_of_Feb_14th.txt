Week of the 14th, I drew up 3 mock-ups for the wire-frame. I also found and watched a video tutorial on Unity.
I helped in the determination of the difficulty of each user story and helped in spreading
them out over 4 Sprints.

Micahel Jordan also looked up unity tutorials and helped to determine the difficulty for the user stories.

Luke took charge in the organizing of our Kanban board and made sure we hit all of the requirements
on our project milestone

Alice drew out our architecture and the use case diagram

Josh also made sure to look up tutorials on Unity
