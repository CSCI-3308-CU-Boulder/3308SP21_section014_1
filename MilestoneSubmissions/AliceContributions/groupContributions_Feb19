My contributions: I helped come up with actors and use cases and drew up the Use Case diagram. I watched the tutorials that my teammates found. I helped out with thinking of the Project Features list and the user stories pertaining to each feature. Also worked alongside my group members to organise the project plan.
Josh's contribution: Found one of the videos that we watched and helped with the organisation of our project plan. Also contributed to coming up with user stories of each feature.
Luke's contribution: Is our scribe so he communicated with our TA about any questions/issues. Wrote up the first TA meeting log. Helped out with the features and organising them by sprint.
Adam's contribution: Shared the second video that we watched. Wrote up a few of the Project Milestone 1 categories. Created all of the wireframes/designs.
Michael's contribution: Helped with most of the Project Milestone 1 categories and worked on feature's list and user stories with the whole group.
