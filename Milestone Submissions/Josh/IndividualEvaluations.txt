First a foremost, all of our group members have gotten along very well and I can see a strong team being formed week by week:

Adam P: Adam drew up the sketches for the game, just quick drawings but it really helped us all visualize what out game will look like, also helped with team tasks.

Alice G: Alice has come up with many prominent user stories and helped delegate the assignees, she also helped everyone with the team tasks.

Luke S: Luke has done a great job being a scribe and keeping track of everything going on with the group as well as helping with all the team tasks

Michael J: Michael has really contibuted with the techinical side of the project and the ideas section, again helping the whole group with team tasks.

We have all greatly contributed to the project so far and there is much more of that to come.
