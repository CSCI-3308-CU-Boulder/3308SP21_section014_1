                <h1>The team working on Space Defenders is a 5 person team consisting of students in varying stages of computer science degrees. We are Josh, Luke, Alice, Michael and Adam.
                </h1>
                </br>
                <p>Right from the start we knew we wanted to make a game. We decided to use the Unity engine for its ease of access as well as the ability to embed in html along with the use of the collaborate function, since we will never actually meet in person. Within Unity, we had to make several scenes, each connected in order to allow the game to play out. We have a database with enemies and towers, along with their upgrades.
                </p>
                </br> 
                <p>Our backend will make use of PostgreSQL. With this we will be able to host a website (locally) where a user can register. This will enter the user into the database, allowing for scores to be kept and viewed.
                </p>
                </br>
                <p>A brief description of our game:
                </p>
                </br>
                <p id="description">Our app is called Space Defender. Space Defender is a tower defence style game capturing all the excitement of futuristic warfare! The game will be hosted on its own website with many features. At the outset, new users will be prompted to create their own profile with a custom username and password. Upon registration, users will then be treated to the most cutting edge graphical interface possible! (within 16 weeks of amateur production by students) Gazing at the amazing functionality of our menu, users can start a new game, view most recent high scores, toggle option buttons and slide option sliders. It may even be possible to send messages to other players (time permitting). From here, users will not be able to contain their excitement and will rush to start a new game. Once a new game is selected, the battlefield will appear and the calm before the storm will settle in. Users will then be prompted to place their first, ultra-futuristic space tower! The placement will be vital because not long afterwards a horde of freedom hating aliens will enter through a predetermined wormhole and follow a strict path right past the newly created tower. As droves of alien scum are obliterated by the mighty Defenders of Space™ , all the money in their space wallets drop, ready to be used by the Defenders of Space™ to buy new towers or upgrade their existing obelisks of alien destruction. There will be as many as 4 or 5 different alien enemies! Who knows? Maybe 6! Maybe 2! If the myriad of species of aliens makes it to the space station the Defenders of Space™ are defending, then damage will be done to the shields. Once the shields are gone, the station is lost and the game is over! Survive a predetermined amount of waves or time (whichever is easier) and you may just save space for all freedom living species! Our users will be casual phone gamers and people who have fifteen minutes to kill. Maybe people waiting in line at the post office.
