Minutes from 10.02.21
-Shruthi asked if we had enough user stories

-It was suggested making a UI mockup, even if it was just pen and paper

-We were told to start on big, critical components and not to focus on little technical details
as big components take the longest

-Presentatons start 12.04.21, So be done by 04.11.21

-We can use any technology from the class. If we use technology from outside the class, we
need to start learning it early so we aren't bottlenecked by it.
